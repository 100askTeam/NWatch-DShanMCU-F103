# Introduction

This project is developed based on the [DShanMCU-F103](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=724601559592) development board (stm32f103c8t6), with the intention of providing a comprehensive example learning reference for learning STM32 and HAL libraries.

This project is based on ZakKemble's open-source project NWatch: [https://github.com/ZakKemble/NWatch](https://github.com/ZakKemble/NWatch) Original author's blog address: [https://blog.zakkemble.net/diy-digital-wristwatch](https://blog.zakkemble.net/diy-digital-wristwatch).

The difference between NWatch DShanMCU F103 and the original author's NWatch is that it was ported to the DShanMCU F103 development board and developed based on the HAL library of ST. Thanks to the convenient configuration of STM32CubeMX during secondary development, some new features were added compared to the original author's NWatch, such as restoring factory settings, which will gradually add more features in the future.
